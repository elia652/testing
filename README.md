To clone the front-end:

git clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/elia652/testing.git

In the project terminal:

npm install

npm run build

npm run dev

You have to be sure that the backend is running

As a setup in your PC: you should have:

_VSC (the most recommended) _Npx(it's a JS package you can downloaded with cmd npm install npx -g)

If you want to create a new nextjs application:

_npx create-next-app@latest nameIt --typescript

In your terminal: cd nameIt

And now you can run it the same way as we said before

(if you want to check all script that you can run them : package.json)
